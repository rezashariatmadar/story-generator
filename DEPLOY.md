# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your AI Story Generator to Railway - a modern cloud platform that makes deployment simple and fast.

## üéØ Quick Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/django)

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code should be in a GitHub repository
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **Ready Codebase** - All deployment files are already configured

## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. **Connect to Railway**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your `story-generator` repository

### 2. **Configure Environment Variables**

Railway will auto-detect this as a Django project. Set these environment variables in the Railway dashboard:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-django-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

**Optional Variables:**
```bash
DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
```

### 3. **Database Setup**

Railway will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Provision a PostgreSQL database
- ‚úÖ Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- ‚úÖ Run migrations on deployment (`python manage.py migrate`)

### 4. **Deploy!**

1. Click **"Deploy"** in Railway dashboard
2. Railway will:
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Run database migrations
   - Collect static files
   - Start your app with Gunicorn

## üéØ Post-Deployment

### **Create Superuser**

After deployment, create an admin user:

1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Environment"**
2. Click **"Terminal"** or use Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Connect to your project
railway link

# Create superuser
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### **Access Your App**

- **Live App**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin/`

## üîí Security Features

Your deployment includes:

- ‚úÖ **HTTPS Enforcement** - All traffic redirected to HTTPS
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers** - HSTS, XSS protection, content type sniffing protection
- ‚úÖ **Secure Cookies** - Session and CSRF cookies secured
- ‚úÖ **Static File Compression** - WhiteNoise with compression
- ‚úÖ **Database Connection Pooling** - Optimized PostgreSQL connections

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Configuration

### **Development vs Production**

- **Local Development**: Uses SQLite database, DEBUG=True
- **Railway Production**: Uses PostgreSQL, DEBUG=False, HTTPS enabled

### **Static Files**

- **WhiteNoise** serves static files efficiently in production
- **Compression** enabled for faster loading
- **CDN-ready** for future optimization

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **502 Bad Gateway**
   - Check logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
   - Ensure migrations ran successfully

2. **Static Files Not Loading**
   - Run: `railway run python manage.py collectstatic`
   - Check `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` in settings

3. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify PostgreSQL service is running
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` format
   - Restart the deployment

### **View Logs**

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or check in Railway dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

## üìä Monitoring

### **Railway Dashboard**

Monitor your app through Railway dashboard:
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Environment**: Environment variables and settings
- **Deployments**: Deployment history and status

### **Health Checks**

The app includes:
- **Health endpoint**: `/` (configured in `railway.toml`)
- **Automatic restarts**: On failure (max 10 retries)
- **Timeout protection**: 100 seconds for health checks

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### **Deploying Updates**

1. **Push to GitHub**: Any push to main branch triggers deployment
2. **Manual Deploy**: Use Railway dashboard "Deploy" button
3. **Rollback**: Use Railway deployment history

### **Database Migrations**

Migrations run automatically on each deployment via the `release` command in `Procfile`:

```bash
release: python manage.py migrate
```

### **Backup Strategy**

1. **Database Backups**: Railway provides automatic PostgreSQL backups
2. **Code Backups**: Your GitHub repository serves as code backup
3. **Static Files**: Regenerated on each deployment

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### **Railway Pricing**

- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month per service
- **Includes**: 512MB RAM, 1GB storage, custom domains
- **Auto-scaling**: Scales based on traffic

### **Optimization Tips**

1. **Resource Monitoring**: Check Railway metrics regularly
2. **Database Optimization**: Monitor PostgreSQL usage
3. **Static Files**: WhiteNoise reduces server load
4. **Logging**: Adjust log levels for production

## üéâ Your App is Live!

Congratulations! Your AI Story Generator is now deployed and ready for users worldwide!

### **Next Steps**

1. **Custom Domain**: Add your own domain in Railway settings
2. **Environment Monitoring**: Set up alerts for uptime
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize based on usage
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback and iterate
